<p align="center">Final project for M-C-S </p>

### Description:

It's weird, but it can be hard to start building something from scratch. We need abstraction as a starting point, which is inspired by what we see.

Pixel abstraction is far from a work of art, minimalism will allow you to concentrate on your own feelings and use the saved drawing as a stencil for a future work.
