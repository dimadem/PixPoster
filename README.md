<p align="center">Final project for M-C-S </p>

### Description:

It's weird, but it might be hard to start building something from
scratch. What if we use abstraction as starting point, which
inspired by imagine and compiling.

Pixel abstraction is far from artwork, but minimalism will allow us to concentrate on feelings and use saved posters as a stencil for a future work.

P5js sketch was inspired by one of the tutorials https://github.com/timrodenbroeker (if you read this Tim, Thank you)
